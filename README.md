**Group Project Title:** Comparative Text Analysis: Sentiment and Discourse on COVID-19 Vaccination in Social Media v. Traditional Media

**Project Members:** Shivani Chowdhry, Dohyo Jeong, Pyung Kim

**Project Overview:** This study aims to explore the differences in how social media and traditional news outlets discuss COVID-19 vaccination. By analyzing tweets and articles from major news outlets such as the New York Times and USA Today, the project seeks to uncover disparities in keyword usage and sentiment toward the vaccine between January and September 2021.

**Objectives:**

To identify the most frequently discussed keywords and sentiments related to COVID-19 vaccination on Twitter versus traditional news media.
To analyze changes in discourse over three distinct periods: before vaccination, during peak vaccination, and during the rise of the Delta variant.

**Methodology:**

* Data Collection: Utilized Twitter API for tweets and Nexis Uni for news articles.
* Text Analysis: Employed frequency analysis, weighted log-odds, and co-occurrence networks to compare and contrast keyword usage and context between the platforms.
* Time Periods Analyzed:
1. Before Vaccination (Jan-Mar 2021): Focus on initial vaccine rollout discussions.
2. After Peak Vaccination (Apr-Jun 2021): Analysis during the period of maximum vaccine uptake.
3. Delta Variant Spread (Jul-Sep 2021): Focus on discussions during the rise of the Delta variant.

**Key Findings:**

1. Twitter discussions frequently centered on vaccine side effects and efficacy, showing a high frequency of related keywords across all time periods.
2. News articles tended to focus more on policy, public health responses, and less on side effects compared to Twitter.
3. Both platforms showed shifts in discourse, with Twitter reflecting public concerns and hesitancy, and news outlets focusing on broader public health and policy implications.

**Visualizations:**

1. Frequency Analysis Graphs: Display the most common keywords across different time periods on Twitter and in news media.
2. Weighted Log-Odds Ratio Graphs: Highlight words that are contextually significant in the discourse on each platform.
3. Co-occurrence Networks: Illustrate the relationships and contextual usage of key terms within the discourse.

Implications: The study provides valuable insights into public sentiment and media portrayal of COVID-19 vaccination, which could inform public health messaging and policy-making.

**Tools and Techniques Used:**

* R Programming: Used for data cleaning, text preprocessing, and analysis.
* Python: Employed for additional data manipulation and analysis.
* APIs: Twitter API for real-time data collection and Nexis Uni for accessing archived news articles.
* Text Mining Packages: Used tm and tidyr for text cleaning and tokenization in R.

**Conclusion:** This comparative analysis underscores the significant role of both social media and traditional news in shaping public opinion on COVID-19 vaccination. Understanding these narratives can help tailor more effective health communication strategies.
